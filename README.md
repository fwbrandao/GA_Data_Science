<a id='welcome'></a>
## Course Overview
Welcome to the part time Data Science course at General Assembly! We are building a global community of lifelong learners who are excited about using data to solve real world problems.

In this program, we will use Python to explore datasets, build predictive models, and communicate data driven insights. Specifically, you will learn how to:

- Define many of the approaches and considerations that data scientists use to solve real world problems.
- Perform exploratory data analysis with powerful programmatic tools in Python.
- Build and refine basic machine learning models to predict patterns from data sets.
- Communicate data driven insights to peers and stakeholders in order to inform business decisions.

### What You Will Learn

- **Statistical Analysis with Python**:
 - Perform visual and statistical analysis on data using Python and its associated libraries and tools.
- **Data-Driven Decision-Making**:
 - Define and determine the trade-offs involving feature selection, model accuracy, and data quality.
- **Machine Learning & Modeling Techniques**:
 - Explore supervised learning techniques, inlcuding classification, regression, and decision trees.
- **Visualizations & Presentations**:
 - Create visualizations and interactive notebooks to present to industry stakeholders.


### Python Version
The curriculum materials for this course are written in Python 3.6.

### Flex Topics

Flex sessions are designed to provide your class with time to catch up, review materials, ask questions, work on projects, or go deeper into specific topic areas.

Later in the course, instructors may optionally choose to cover additional topics, depending on the needs of your course. Some examples include:

## Project Structure

This course will ask you to complete a project in order to practice and apply the skills covered in-class.


### Final Project

In our final project, we'll ask you to apply your skills to a real-world or business problem of your choice.

This is an opportunity for you to demonstrate your new skills and tackle a pressing issue relevant to your life, industry, or organisation. Youâ€™ll create a hypothesis, analyse internal data, and generate a working model, prototype, solution, or recommendation.

You will get structured guidance and designated time to work throughout the course. Final project deliverables include:

- **Proposal**: Describe your chosen problem and identify relevant data sets (confirming access, as needed).
- **Brief**:  Share a summary of your initial analysis and your next steps with your instructional team.
- **Report**: Submit a cleanly formatted Jupyter notebook (or other files) documenting your code and process for technical/peer stakeholders.
- **Presentation**: Present a summary of your business problem, approach, and recommendation to an audience of non-technical executive stakeholders.
