    "# <font color='blue'> What's Python and why are we learning it?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why does Python have such a ridiculous name?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python was initially developed by Guido van Rossum in the 1990s, who was a big fan of Monty Python's Flying Circus, a BBC comedy sketch series televised during the late 60s and early 70s. It was conceived, written and performed by the comedians collectively known as Monty Python (or simply 'the Pythons').\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/monty_python.jpg\" width=400 />\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python is open source**\n",
    "\n",
    "This means it's free to use and distribute, and anyone can modify/customise the source code. This might seem surprising to anyone with experience of working in the private sector, but many huge advances in science and technology are only possible thanks to open source culture and a tradition of people freely sharing, distributing, modifying their own and each other's work. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can learn more about open source here: https://opensource.org/\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python is an interpreted language**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're new to programming, you probably have no idea what this means. Let's take a quick(ish) detour through the history of computing. \n",
    "\n",
    "**What is programming?**\n",
    "\n",
    "What do we actually mean when we talk about coding or programming? This sounds like an obvious question, but it's worth discussing.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we write code (in any language from Python to C++) we're writing instructions that we want our computer to execute; those instructions could be as simple as 'add these two numbers and show me the result' or as complex as 'navigate this driverless car through rush hour traffic.' \n",
    "\n",
    "The CPU (central processing unit, or 'brain') in any computer can only understand and execute commands written in machine code, which looks something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/machine_code.png\" width=400 />\n",
    "\n",
    "For humans, machine code is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Very error prone \n",
    "* A nightmare to debug: imagine trying to spot a rogue 1 (Star Wars reference entirely unintentional but I'll take it) in a string of thousands of numbers and letters so you can fix your mistake\n",
    "* Inefficient: it takes many lines of code to write even the simplest instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, nowadays we have at our disposal a huge range of programming languages from JavaScipt to Python to C++. All of these are much more similar to the English language, have their own vocabulary (commands that can be given to the computer) and syntax (rules for combining commands to write complex instructions) and feel far more intuitive than machine code.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if computers only understand machine code, how is this possible?\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/grace_hopper.jpg\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 1950s a US Navy Rear Admiral named Grace Hopper was well aware of this problem. She built the first compiler, a middle-man piece of software that translated instructions written in a human-readable programming language called A-0 into computer-readable machine code. \n",
    "\n",
    "All the programming languages you might have heard of including FORTRAN, C++, Python, JavaScript, Swift, R and Matlab only exist today because of Hopper's innovation.\n",
    "\n",
    "These modern languages are compiled or interpreted into a format that can be directly executed by a CPU. The main difference between a compiled language (like C++) and an interpreted language (like Python) lies in the result of the compilation or interpretation process. \n",
    "\n",
    "Code written in an interpreted language is executed by an interpreter, which reads the source code and translates it on the fly into machine code, and gives us the desired result or output of the code- this could be a number, some text, or movement in a robotic arm. This means we can type statements into the interpreter and they are executed immediately, giving us near-instant results. The source code has to be re-interpreted each time the code is executed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lines of code written in compiled languages are converted into machine code by a compiler, to produce an executable file. To get the desired results of the code, this executable file then needs to be run. Most of the software we use on a daily basis is delivered as compiled binaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python has a library for almost anything**\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, a library is a big bundle of code snippets (or functions) that someone else has written and made freely available for other people to download and modify (open source culture again!). A single library will usually be designed to help people write code for specific applications or purposes. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pandas is a library for data science\n",
    "* Numpy is a library for numerical computing\n",
    "* NLTK is a library for natural language processing\n",
    "* Tensorflow is a machine learning library released by Google \n",
    "\n",
    "Using libraries rather than writing your own code from scratch is always a smart move (as one of my favourite undergraduate tutors used to say, a good engineer is smart and lazy)- you'll save time, and because open source code will have been reviewed and checked by hundreds and thousands of people, code from a library is far less likely to contain bugs than something you write on your laptop at 2am after your 10th cup of coffee of the day. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Python is object oriented**\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming, or OOP for short, is a way of structuring programs so that groups of properties and behaviours are bundled into things called 'objects'.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll learn more about why this is useful later."

    "### What's an IDE?\n",
    "\n",
    "We've downloaded Python. What does that actually mean? What exactly have we just installed on our machines? \n",
    "\n",
    "When we download and install Python, we download the Python interpreter- that is, a program that can take lines of code written in Python and translate them down to machine code and show us the results. That's great! But we need somewhere to feed lines of Python code to that interpreter, or in other words we need somewhere to write, test, and run our code and view the results or output. That's what an IDE or interactive development environment is for. \n",
    "\n",
    "An IDE is anywhere that you can write and run code, and see the results. There are lots of different IDEs available- some can be used to run code in many different programming languages (like Microsoft Visual Studio Code) and some can only handle one language (like pyCharm). \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a quick tour of a few different, commonly used, Python IDEs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The command line**\n",
    "\n",
    "Typing ```python``` into the command line will launch Python in your Terminal window. You can then type Python commands, run them, and see the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/command_line.png\" width='500' />\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a quick and easy way of running code, but not well suited to writing longer blocks of code (we call these 'scripts') or saving the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Text editors**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can write Python script in any text editor (Notepad, Atom, Sublime) and as long as you save it with a .py extension, it can be run from the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/atom.png\" width='500'/>\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/run_atom.png\" width='500'/>\n",
    "\n",
    "**pyCharm**\n",
    "\n",
    "pyCharm is a powerful IDE with lots of features to make writing, running and testing code easier. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/pycharm.png\" width='500'/>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Jupyter**\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebook is just another example of an IDE, or interactive development environment. It has some neat features that make it particularly well suited to writing and running readable, shareable, nicely formatted code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Text Editors**\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to IDEs, developers also use text editors to create or edit code and files. Text editors or more commonly used for files that are executed via the command line, as well as for software and website development.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Some common text editors that you may see or use include\n",
    "- [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/)\n",
    "- [Atom](https://atom.io/)\n",
    "- [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (Windows)\n",
    "- [Vim](http://www.vim.org/)\n",

    "\n",
    "### What is Jupyter?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter Notebook (previously known as IPython) is an IDE that launches in your web browser but runs locally on your machine. \n",
    "\n",
    "It allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. Jupyter Notebooks have the .ipynb extension, although it is possible to export them as .py files, or even .html or .pdf files for easy sharing and presentation. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of advantages of using a Jupyter notebook. It's interactive, easy to share and document results, and because equations/notes/graphs can be embedded in a notebook it's easy for other people to understand what you've done and why you've done it- which is incredibly important when checking, sharing, and reviewing results. Jupyter is also an IDE that can run many different programming languages (sometimes they're called kernels) from R to JavaScript, so it's versatile too. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many researchers (and large companies including Netflix: https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/notebook-innovation-591ee3221233) have become reliant on Jupyter notebooks to explain their results. Readers can reproduce those results and modify to create different output in order to facilitate the learning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "**Launching** Jupyter can be launched from Anaconda Navigator. It runs in your web browser, but doesn't require an internet connection to work- remember, Python and the IDE are both running locally in your machine, your browser is just a convenient user interface. \n",
    "\n",
    "A new notebook can be launched by selecting New, followed by Python 3. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/launch_notebook.png\" width='500'/>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cells** Cells are the building blocks of Jupyter notebooks, and can contain different types of content from code, to markdown (nicely formatted text, like this cell) to LaTeX (for writing mathematical formulae) and embedded images. During this seminar we'll be using mostly code cells (to write and run our code) and markdown cells. \n",
    "\n",
    "New cells are inserted by selecting Insert, followed by Insert Cell Above or Insert Cell Below. The dropdown menu allows us to switch between Markdown cells and Code cells. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Running cells** Cells run one after the other. You can run cells by pressing Shift + Enter. The output from a code cell (if there is any) will appear below the cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Stopping cells running** If you'd like to stop a cell running (maybe you've accidentally written some code that runs in an infinite loop) you can use \n",
    "\n",
    "**Saving your work** Jupyter will autosave your work once every couple of minutes, but if you've just completed a very critical piece of code, it's best to save manually as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Shortcuts** Jupyter has plenty of shortcuts to save time:\n",
    "\n",
    "``Shift + Enter``: Run current cell\n",
    "\n",
    "``Esc+M``: Convert current cell to markdown\n",
    "\n",
    "``Esc+Y``: Convert current cell to code \n",
    "\n",
    "``Esc + A``: Insert new cell above current cell\n",
    "\n",
    "``Esc + B``: Insert new cell below current cell\n",
